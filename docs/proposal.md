# Introduction

Currently, the Wellness and Spa Center's receptionists manage client bookings. As business thrives, receptionists are struggling to balance bookings with other administrative tasks. Clients are also complaining about long wait times, and employees feel overworked due to handling a high volume of clients. These challenges highlight the need to automate the booking process to monitor the number of clients each therapist handles and prevent employee dissatisfaction. The proposed system will also allow receptionists to focus on admnistrative tasks, enabling them to serve clients promptly. Overall, the Center will benefit from increased bookings as clients will no longer need to visit the reception or call to make appointments.


The Application Management System aims to streamline the appointment booking process at the Wellness and Spa Center. Clients will use the system to book specific time slots for services. After booking, they can use the system to cancel or reschedule their appointments. The system will also send notifications about upcoming appointments, helping to minimize cancellations by keeping clients updated. Cancellation and rescheduling will adhere to the company's policies, ensuring that last-minute cancellations, such as those made some few hours before an appointment, may incur charges. These policies will ensure that the system is not misused.

# Anticipated Technologies

The proposed system is a web application that requires both front and backend development.

**Frontend**

- ReactJs
- Boostrap

**Backend**

- Node.js with Express

**Database**

- Firebase Firestore

**Authentication**

- Firebase Authentication

**Payment**

- Stripe


# Method/Approach

Scrum will be used in the software development process because it allows self-organizing and self-direction. Sprints will be one or two weeks long, depending on the complexity of the tasks involved. The developer will participate in daily "personal standups" to discuss what was achieved the previous day, what will be done that day, and any obtacles faced. Execution will involve working on small tasks and tracking progress.

At the end of each sprint, there will be a sprint review to provide feedback on what has been completed and tests performed. The review will also identify what went well and any obstacles encountered. Feedback from the previous sprint will be incorporated into the next sprint. The project sponsor will also receive weekly written updates on progress and challenges.

The sprints will be tracked on a Trello Board, and the daily stand-up meetings will be recorded on the Todoist App. The progress recorded on the Todoist App and Trello Board will be used to compile the weekly updates for the project sponsor.

This approach will help me to stay organized and continuously improve through the weekly and daily stand-ups.

# Estimated Timeline

Week 1 (September 29 - October 5): UML Designs - Focus on creating use case, activity diagrams, and defining system architecture

Week 2 - 3 (October 6 - October 19): Set up environment, build backend APIs and Database integration. It includes any initial unit testing of backend components.

Week 4 - 5 (October 20 - November 2): Develop core frontend components and designs, and user interface. It includes any initial unit testing of frontend components.

Week 6 - 7 (November 3 - November 16): Integrate backend with frontend, and setup payment functionality.

Week 8 (November 17 - November 23): Refine any remaining features.

Week 9 (November 24 - November 30): Perform integration testing and make final adjustments.

# Anticipated Problems

Delays due to learning new concepts: I need to integrate Stripe API. It is unclear how long it will take to understand and use the API. I plan to read the documentation and use online tools such as Chatgpt to understand their usage. I may also seek help from colleagues who are experienced with these APIs.

Delays due to debugging errors: I may encounter errors that will take longer than expected to debug. I plan to look for solutions online and seek help from colleagues if an error takes more than a week to resolve. Meanwhile, I will continue working on other tasks, especially those unrelated to the error.

Alternative technologies: If some technologies are difficult to implement, I will consider alternatives. For example, I could deploy backend services using Firebase functions instead of Heroku.
