Discussion points:

* For the past two weeks, I have been working on integrating the Stripe API.
I found a way to do it using a Payment Link that is created on Stripe's dashboard. I implemented it, but I cannot use it because I need to associate the payment with an appointment using an appointment Id that changes dynamically.
* I have also started defining the other data models but they are dependent on integration with Stripe API so I am working on that.

Goals for next week
* Finishing Stripe API integration. 
* Finishing creating the other models or backend endpoints.
* Write unit tests and documentation
